                    Design the Organisation for Strategy—Not Just for Leaders</h1>
                <div class="case-study-content">
                    <p>Organisation design is one of the most powerful tools leaders have to translate strategy into
                        execution. It shapes how decisions are made, how teams collaborate, and how value flows through
                        the
                        business.</p>
                    <p>During periods of growth or transition, design decisions are often influenced by a range of
                        factors
                        beyond strategy alone. Leadership experience, individual strengths, and the need to retain key
                        talent naturally play a role. These considerations are understandable and, in many cases, well
                        intentioned.</p>
                    <p>Over time, however, when roles, structures, or spans of control are shaped primarily around
                        individuals rather than business needs, subtle misalignments can begin to emerge. What initially
                        provides continuity or stability can gradually introduce complexity, slow decision making, or
                        dilute
                        accountability.</p>
                    <p>As organisations evolve, these effects can make execution harder and reduce organisational
                        agility.
                        This is not a reflection of poor intent, but of the natural tension between people
                        considerations
                        and strategic clarity.</p>
                    <p>When organisation design is anchored first in strategy, work requirements, and value creation, it
                        becomes a powerful enabler of sustainable performance. In that context, the organisation is
                        better
                        equipped to scale, adapt, and deliver on its strategic ambitions.</p>

                    <h3>Strategy First. Then Design. Then Leadership.</h3>
                    <p>The idea that “structure follows strategy” is well established, thanks to thinkers like Jay
                        Galbraith
                        and Alfred Chandler. But in practice, it is often misunderstood—or selectively applied.</p>
                    <p>To apply it with rigour, leaders must commit to this sequence:</p>
                    <p><strong>1. Start with strategy</strong><br>
                        What does the business need to deliver? What customer value, operating rhythm, or market
                        capabilities are essential?</p>
                    <p><strong>2. Design the organisation to enable that strategy</strong><br>
                        What structural choices—around roles, teams, workflows, and decision rights—will best support
                        the
                        delivery of these goals?</p>
                    <p><strong>3. Then place and develop leaders within that model</strong><br>
                        Do we have the leadership capabilities to operate effectively in this design? If not, how will
                        we
                        build them?</p>
                    <p>This order—strategy → design → leadership—is not optional. When it’s reversed, organisations
                        become
                        hostage to legacy preferences rather than future needs.</p>

                    <h3>What Goes Wrong When We Design Around Leaders</h3>
                    <p>When structures are shaped to fit individual leaders, rather than business priorities, a number
                        of
                        predictable challenges arise:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Redundant roles and unclear accountability:</strong> Roles are created to ‘fit
                            people
                            in’ rather than solve for clear needs, leading to duplication and blurred ownership.</li>
                        <li><strong>Inefficient spans and uneven workloads:</strong> Some leaders end up stretched thin
                            while others operate in silos, often because comfort or loyalty dictated structure.</li>
                        <li><strong>Decision gridlock and turf conflict:</strong> Overlapping mandates and vague
                            boundaries
                            create friction, slowing down execution and diffusing responsibility.</li>
                        <li><strong>Development bottlenecks:</strong> Leaders are placed into roles without adequate
                            support
                            or challenge, assuming past success translates into future fit.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Designing around individuals may seem like a people-first approach. In reality, it often
                        undermines
                        both individual effectiveness and enterprise performance.</p>

                    <h3>Leadership Fit Must Be Intentional</h3>
                    <p>Of course, structure alone doesn’t deliver results—people do. But that’s precisely why matching
                        leadership to the demands of the model is essential.</p>
                    <p>This doesn’t mean removing people. It means deploying them with intent, based on the capabilities
                        and
                        mindset needed to succeed in the new design.</p>
                    <p>Leaders must ask:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Does this person have the adaptability, systems thinking, and collaboration skills this
                            model
                            requires?</li>
                        <li>Are they prepared to lead across boundaries—not just within a silo?</li>
                        <li>What development or coaching might help them grow into the role, rather than around it?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Just because someone thrived under the old model doesn’t guarantee they will excel in the new
                        one.
                        Every design shift is also a leadership shift.</p>

                    <h3>Design and Leadership Should Reinforce Each Other</h3>
                    <p>The most effective organisations don’t trade-off between structural clarity and leadership
                        alignment.
                        They design for the future—and prepare their leaders to operate within it.</p>
                    <p>This creates a reinforcing loop:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Strategy drives the organisation’s design.</li>
                        <li>Design defines how the business should work.</li>
                        <li>Leaders are selected and supported to bring that design to life.</li>
                        <li>And through this alignment, execution improves and momentum builds.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When strategy, structure, and leadership are synchronized, teams operate with greater clarity,
                        energy, and direction. Strategic outcomes are no longer aspirational—they become achievable and
                        sustainable.</p>

                    <h3>Design with Courage, Lead with Clarity</h3>
                    <p>Organisation design is not about drawing charts to suit personalities. It’s about creating the
                        conditions for sustained success.</p>
                    <p>That sometimes means making tough decisions: redesigning senior roles, clarifying accountability,
                        or
                        asking leaders to stretch beyond their comfort zones.</p>
                    <p>The critical question is not “Where should this person go?”</p>
                    <p>It’s “What does our strategy require—and what kind of leadership will make it real?”</p>
                    <p>When leaders approach design with this mindset, they move beyond reorganisation. They build a
                        stronger bridge between ambition and action—and lay the foundation for long-term performance,
                        adaptability, and growth.</p>
