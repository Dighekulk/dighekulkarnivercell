                <div class="about-content">
                    <p>Dighe Kulkarni Org Advisors is a specialist consulting firm focused on Organisation Design —
                        helping
                        companies unlock performance by aligning structure, talent, and execution with strategy.</p>
                    <p>We were founded on a clear belief: When organisations are designed well, people thrive, decisions
                        move faster, and businesses grow with purpose.</p>
                    <p>Founded by Amruta Dighe Kulkarni, former Talent & Organisation Consulting Director at Accenture,
                        the firm brings over 20+ years of experience in large-scale transformation, people-centered
                        design, and leadership capability building. With deep consulting roots across India and
                        Singapore, we translate strategic intent into organisation models that work — structurally,
                        culturally, and operationally.</p>
                    <p>We work with promoters, CXOs, HR leaders, and investors across Indian and global conglomerates,
                        family-run businesses, mid-sized growth firms, and scaling start-ups — spanning FMCG, Retail,
                        BFSI, Healthcare, Tech, and the Public Sector.</p>

                        thoughtfulness, and relevance to the world of L&D. In her spare time, she loves to stay active
                        through fitness, explore new places with her husband, and connect with people wherever she goes.

                        What sets
                        her apart is not just her depth of experience, but her ability to quickly grasp the nuances of a

                        an
                        intuitive understanding of complex challenges, always looking at the issue from multiple angles.
                        Amruta is my go-to person for any advisory support in Org and Leadership Design, and I highly

                            processes, people, rewards, and culture — with your business strategy. This alignment

                            <li><strong>Corporate Strategy</strong> defines where the business is going.</li>
                            <li><strong>Organisation Design</strong> shapes how it will get there — through roles,
                                decision rights, and collaboration models.</li>
                            <li><strong>HR Strategy</strong> ensures you have the right talent and workforce to deliver.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Organisation Development</strong> focuses on mindset, behaviour, and cultural

                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Think of it this way:</strong> Strategy sets the direction. Design builds the engine.
                            HR powers the people. Development shapes the culture.</p>
                        <p>At Dighe Kulkarni Org Advisors, we work at the intersection of all these elements. While our

                            enabling agility, reducing dependence on a few individuals, and building execution muscle
                            for the future.</p>

                        <p>Great talent needs the right environment to thrive. Without clear roles, decision rights, and
                            collaboration models, even top performers struggle. Org Design helps convert talent
                            potential into sustained impact — a critical gap in many firms investing in leadership and

                            decisions to scalable, professionalised models — critical for growth, succession, and
