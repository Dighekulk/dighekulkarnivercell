                    GenAI and the Future of Organisation Design: A Global Perspective with an Indian Lens</h1>
                <div class="case-study-content">
                    <p>By mid-2025, Generative AI (GenAI) is no longer an emerging trend—it is an embedded force,
                        transforming how businesses operate across sectors, geographies, and functions.</p>
                    <p>From content generation and customer engagement to data analysis and decision support, GenAI is
                        shifting the nature of work itself. But as companies rush to adopt AI tools, a critical question
                        remains unanswered:</p>
                    <p><strong>Are we designing our organisations to actually use them?</strong></p>
                    <p>Most companies are evolving their tech stacks—but not their operating models. Tools are changing,
                        but
                        structures, roles, and workflows are often stuck in a pre-AI era. This disconnect limits the
                        value
                        of GenAI and increases friction, risk, and inefficiency.</p>
                    <p>To harness AI’s full potential, organisation design must evolve alongside it—not as an HR
                        initiative,
                        but as a core leadership responsibility.</p>

                    <h3>Globally: Work Is Changing—And So Must Design</h3>
                    <p>Around the world, leading organisations are reimagining how work gets done with GenAI. They’re
                        not
                        just automating tasks—they’re redesigning how people, machines, and teams interact.</p>
                    <p>Some of the shifts already underway include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Automating low-value work:</strong> Routine tasks—such as report writing, contract
                            drafting, or data cleaning—are now handled by AI, freeing human capacity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Enabling real-time decisions:</strong> AI tools deliver instant insights and
                            recommendations, reducing delays and decentralising decision-making.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reconfiguring end-to-end journeys:</strong> Customer onboarding, claims processing,
                            product design, and campaign planning are being restructured to work in AI-augmented cycles.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>But here's the catch: layering GenAI on top of legacy structures is not enough. Without
                        rethinking
                        organisation design, AI adoption stalls or—even worse—introduces new risks.</p>



                    <h3>Four Ways Organisation Design Is Evolving</h3>
                    <p>To unlock the promise of GenAI, organisations must rethink four foundational design dimensions:
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>1. Redefining Roles for Human–AI Collaboration</strong><br>
                        As AI takes over repetitive tasks, human roles must shift toward judgment, oversight,
                        creativity,
                        and contextual understanding. Organisation design must reimagine job profiles to include AI
                        fluency,
                        introduce new roles (e.g., prompt engineers, AI ethicists), and clarify workflows where AI leads
                        versus where human intervention is critical.</p>

                    <p><strong>2. Enhancing Connection to Accelerate Decisions</strong><br>
                        GenAI dramatically shortens the distance between insight and action. But to realise this
                        potential,
                        organisations must reduce friction in how decisions are made. Design must enable faster
                        decision-making by clarifying who decides what, strengthen connections between teams, and equip
                        frontline teams with the context to act confidently.</p>

                    <p><strong>3. Breaking Silos for Cross-Functional Execution</strong><br>
                        GenAI creates value when data, tools, and teams are integrated. Traditional siloed structures
                        limit
                        its effectiveness. Design must move from rigid functions to outcome-based squads or pods and
                        encourage “fusion teams” of product, tech, analytics, and business leads.</p>

                    <p><strong>4. Embedding Governance for Safe and Ethical AI Use</strong><br>
                        As GenAI scales, so do risks like hallucinations, data leakage, and bias. Design must establish
                        clear accountability for AI decision-making and oversight and integrate responsible AI practices
                        into everyday workflows.</p>

                    <h3>With an Indian Lens: The Challenge and Opportunity</h3>
                    <p>India represents one of the most dynamic markets for GenAI adoption—due to its combination of
                        deep
                        digital talent, growing enterprise maturity, and sheer scale. But Indian organisations also face
                        a
                        set of distinctive tensions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Scale + Speed:</strong> India is scaling rapidly. Yet legacy structures and
                            hierarchical
                            cultures often slow down execution. GenAI demands flatter, faster models.</li>
                        <li><strong>Control + Creativity:</strong> Promoter-led or family-owned businesses bring strong
                            continuity—but also centralised decision-making. AI thrives in distributed, agile teams.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Talent + Turnover:</strong> India offers exceptional tech talent but also faces high
                            attrition and rising career expectations. Design must enable growth, not just efficiency.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Global Reach + Local Relevance:</strong> Indian firms often operate under global
                            frameworks while delivering to local markets. This calls for dual-operating models—balancing
                            standardisation with contextual flexibility.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Four Design Imperatives for Indian Organisations</h3>
                    <p>To remain competitive, Indian firms must act decisively:</p>
                    <ol style="padding-left: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem; color: var(--text-dark); margin-bottom: 24px;">
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Loosen Legacy Hierarchies:</strong> Empower teams to
                            act on
                            AI insights without waiting for approvals. Clarify decision rights and reduce dependency on
                            top-down control.</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Shift from Cost Centers to Capability Hubs:</strong>
                            Move
                            beyond positioning India as the back office. Use GenAI to elevate roles toward innovation,
                            design, and ownership.</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Reskill Beyond Tools:</strong> Training must go beyond
                            prompt engineering. Invest in AI literacy, business storytelling, ethical decision-making,
                            and
                            cross-functional collaboration.</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Design for Dual Mandates:</strong> Balance the needs of
                            global consistency with local autonomy. AI-powered operating models must flex across
                            business
                            units, markets, and governance levels.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>How Leaders Can Respond</h3>
                    <p>Whether leading a global firm with Indian operations or a domestic enterprise with international
                        ambitions, leaders should ask:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Are we structured for speed, not just scale?</li>
                        <li>Are we encouraging collaboration across silos, not just within functions?</li>
                        <li>Do we have clear accountability for AI use, risk, and impact?</li>
                        <li>Are we building future-ready capabilities, not just new roles?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Final Word: Design Is the Missing Link Between AI and Impact</h3>
                    <p>GenAI is changing the what of work. Organisation design must now change the how.</p>
                    <p>Globally, the most forward-thinking companies aren’t just investing in AI—they’re redesigning
                        their
                        organisations to unleash it. In India, where transformation meets tradition, the stakes are even
                        higher.</p>
                    <p>Those who rethink roles, simplify structures, enable faster decisions, and embed responsible AI
                        governance will move from experimentation to true competitive advantage.</p>
                    <p>Because in the GenAI era, technology alone is not enough.</p>
                    <p>Design is the differentiator.</p>
