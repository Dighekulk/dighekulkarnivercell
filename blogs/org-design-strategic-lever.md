In 2025, transformation is no longer a project. It’s a permanent condition.

Generative AI, shifting stakeholder expectations, and evolving models of work are fundamentally reshaping how value is created—who creates it, how it's delivered, and where it flows. Businesses are entering new markets, redesigning customer value propositions, and building interconnected digital ecosystems at unprecedented speed.

And yet, one of the most critical enablers of this transformation—organisation design—remains an afterthought.

In too many firms, it enters the conversation after the strategy is set, after a new digital solution is launched, or after execution problems emerge. By then, its potential to create clarity, alignment, and speed has already been diluted.

### Organisation Design: Not Just Structure, But System

Mention “organisation design,” and most executives immediately picture boxes and lines—org charts, reporting hierarchies, spans of control.

But real organisation design goes deeper. It’s about how work actually gets done, especially in a hybrid, AI-augmented world.

Done well, it determines:
* How decisions are made—and who makes them
* How teams collaborate across boundaries
* Where leaders focus their time and attention
* How strategy is translated into everyday action

Poor design, by contrast, reveals itself quickly: siloed execution, slow decisions, bloated governance, duplicated efforts, unclear roles, or attrition of top talent. In many Indian and global firms, the typical response is to layer on communication, training, or engagement campaigns. These are often surface-level solutions that don’t address the root issue.

### Why It Remains Overlooked

If organisation design is so critical, why is it still underused?

Three reasons stand out:

**1. Its ROI is indirect and long-term.**
Design doesn’t generate immediate financial returns like a new product or tech investment. Its impact—on collaboration, speed, and execution—shows up over time, and is harder to measure.

**2. It demands difficult conversations.**
Redesigning how work gets done often requires confronting long-standing power structures, legacy roles, or “sacred cows.” Many leadership teams would rather avoid the discomfort.

**3. It feels complex—and slow.**
Especially in fast-growth sectors like fintech, D2C, and e-commerce in India, leaders tend to deprioritize design. “We’ll fix the org later,” they say. But by the time they do, execution is already misfiring.

### Emerging Trends Reinforcing the Case for Design

Across industries and regions, leading firms are beginning to treat organisation design not as a reactive fix, but a proactive strategic tool. Consider these examples:

* **Networked structures:** Companies like Unilever and Tata are experimenting with flatter, network-based models that accelerate decision-making and reduce handoffs.
* **Capability pods with ownership:** Unicorns such as Zomato and Zepto are using cross-functional pods with P&L responsibility, pushing ownership to the edges of the business.
* **AI-ready models:** Progressive firms are not just adding AI—they’re rethinking workflows, governance, and roles to unlock human-machine collaboration at scale.
* **Skills-first design:** Organisations like Infosys and Wipro are shifting from rigid job architectures to more fluid, skills-based deployment—improving adaptability in both tech and talent.
* **Governance clarity at scale:** As conglomerates scale digital subsidiaries or JVs, they’re investing in decision-rights mapping to reduce ambiguity and accelerate execution.

All of these are design choices—not simply structural charts.

### The Hidden Driver of Execution

Even the most brilliant strategy will falter without a fit-for-purpose organisation behind it.

Strong design unlocks:
* Faster, better decisions, with clear roles and accountability
* Greater agility, by reducing hierarchy and enabling empowered teams
* Improved alignment, ensuring teams know both what to deliver and how to work together
* Higher engagement, with meaningful work, autonomy, and development pathways

Today’s businesses are moving fast—but their internal operating models often can’t keep up. Outdated structures—centralized control, linear planning, excessive layering—are holding them back.

What drives results now are design principles that prioritize:
* Speed over size
* Adaptability over certainty
* Empowerment over control

When design is misaligned, the symptoms are unmistakable: slow decisions, blurred accountability, redundant meetings, disengaged talent.

### Bringing Design Into the Strategy Room

The good news: you don’t need a full-scale overhaul to start.

Smart firms are adopting micro-design interventions—realigning decision forums, redefining team mandates, clarifying cross-functional accountabilities, and simplifying structures layer by layer.

The starting point? Better questions:
* Are we designed to deliver what matters most?
* Where are decisions getting stuck—or duplicated?
* Are teams clear on who owns what?
* Are our roles and workflows fit for an AI-augmented world?
* Are we building the capabilities needed for future growth?

These are not HR questions. They are leadership questions.

### From Afterthought to Advantage

Organisation design isn’t back-office plumbing. It’s the infrastructure that connects ambition to action.

It is the engine that translates strategy into execution, vision into velocity.

In a world where disruption is constant, and agility is the new currency, design is no longer a “nice to have.” It’s the core lever for resilience, reinvention, and results.

If your organisation is bold in ambition but slow in delivery, it’s time to reframe the conversation—not just around what you want to do, but how you are set up to succeed.
