In many organisations, “org design” still evokes images of big announcements, new reporting lines, and cascading org charts. There’s usually a burst of activity—town halls, alignment workshops, updated job descriptions—and then, slowly, a drift back to business as usual.

But real organisation design doesn’t end with a reorg. In fact, it doesn’t even begin with structure.

Recent research has shown that redesigns are becoming a regular operating rhythm, not a rare event. In McKinsey’s early 2014 India study, nearly half of the Executives said redesigns were abandoned before implementation. But by 2025, completion rates rose sharply to 79%. What changed? Organisations began treating redesign as an ongoing capability rather than a crisis response.

Across markets, two-thirds of leaders have been through an operating-model redesign in just the past two years, and half expect to undergo another in the next two. That pattern signals an important shift: companies must build design readiness as a muscle, not treat redesign as a one-time fix.

### Structure Is Only the Start

As Jay Galbraith famously said: “Structure is not organisation.”

The true value of organisation design lies in how the model is held, implemented, and evolved over time. A design cannot succeed if it only shifts boxes. It must align strategy, structure, governance, decision rights, processes, rewards, and people practices so the business can operate with clarity, speed, and purpose.

### Why One-and-Done Fails

Too often, org design is treated as a temporary remedy—cutting cost, supporting a new strategy, or refreshing a function. But once the structure is launched, leadership attention moves elsewhere.

What happens next is predictable:
* Old habits reappear
* Decision rights blur
* New layers get added to old processes
* Matrix tensions resurface
* And after 12–18 months, complexity returns—sometimes worse than before

This happens when redesign is approached as a project, not as a leadership discipline.

### Holding the Design: The Hardest Part for Leaders

Organisation design is inherently fragile. Even the best design will falter without leaders who actively steward it.

Holding the design means:
* Reinforcing new ways of working
* Modelling behaviours that match the intent of the design
* Avoiding constant, reactive “tweaks” at the first sign of discomfort

This does not make the design rigid. Organisations must evolve. But evolution should be guided by principles, not by day-to-day pressures.

Progressive companies use design principles such as:
* What must remain standardised, and where agility is essential
* What should be centralised vs. owned close to the customer
* How to balance alignment with autonomy
* Which roles are pivotal for scale and capability

These principles act as guardrails—allowing the organisation to adapt without drifting.

### Implementation to the Last Mile

Most design failures are not design failures at all—they’re implementation failures.

To embed design deeply into day-to-day operations, organisations must convert intent into practice:
* Cascading clarity so every team knows its purpose, decisions, and interdependencies
* Aligned metrics and incentives that reinforce the new way of working
* Equipped managers who can lead collaboration across new boundaries
* Adjusted routines and governance so meetings, decisions, and workflows reflect the new design

Galbraith’s Star Model remains a powerful reminder: structure is only one lever. Process, people systems, culture, and rewards must all align if the design is to take root.

### Adapt Without Undoing the Model

Markets shift. Priorities evolve. New opportunities arise.

But effective organisations do not respond by constantly redesigning. Instead, they adapt within the logic of the original design.

This is the difference between:
* Iteration vs. churn
* Intelligent flexibility vs. organisational drift

When leaders understand the design intent, they can adjust roles, boundaries, and governance without unravelling clarity or recreating old patterns.

### Make Design a Leadership Habit

The real test of organisation design isn’t the excitement on launch day. It’s whether the design continues to enable coherence, speed, and clarity six, twelve, or twenty-four months later.

That demands leaders treat org design as a habit:
* A shared leadership responsibility, not an HR task
* A lens to diagnose execution issues
* A capability that grows as the business grows
* A framework for decisions around people, performance, and investment

When this happens, good organisation design becomes nearly invisible—it shows up in how work flows, how decisions are made, and how teams collaborate.

Lasting impact doesn’t come from redesigning often. It comes from designing well, implementing with discipline, and evolving with intent.

When organisation design becomes a leadership discipline, it shifts from a one-off exercise into a source of sustained strategic advantage.

In a world demanding both adaptability and performance, few leadership habits matter more.
