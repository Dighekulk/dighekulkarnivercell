Organisation design is one of the most powerful tools leaders have to translate strategy into execution. It shapes how decisions are made, how teams collaborate, and how value flows through the business.

During periods of growth or transition, design decisions are often influenced by a range of factors beyond strategy alone. Leadership experience, individual strengths, and the need to retain key talent naturally play a role. These considerations are understandable and, in many cases, well intentioned.

Over time, however, when roles, structures, or spans of control are shaped primarily around individuals rather than business needs, subtle misalignments can begin to emerge. What initially provides continuity or stability can gradually introduce complexity, slow decision making, or dilute accountability.

As organisations evolve, these effects can make execution harder and reduce organisational agility. This is not a reflection of poor intent, but of the natural tension between people considerations and strategic clarity.

When organisation design is anchored first in strategy, work requirements, and value creation, it becomes a powerful enabler of sustainable performance. In that context, the organisation is better equipped to scale, adapt, and deliver on its strategic ambitions.

### Strategy First. Then Design. Then Leadership.

The idea that “structure follows strategy” is well established, thanks to thinkers like Jay Galbraith and Alfred Chandler. But in practice, it is often misunderstood—or selectively applied.

To apply it with rigour, leaders must commit to this sequence:

**1. Start with strategy**
What does the business need to deliver? What customer value, operating rhythm, or market capabilities are essential?

**2. Design the organisation to enable that strategy**
What structural choices—around roles, teams, workflows, and decision rights—will best support the delivery of these goals?

**3. Then place and develop leaders within that model**
Do we have the leadership capabilities to operate effectively in this design? If not, how will we build them?

This order—strategy → design → leadership—is not optional. When it’s reversed, organisations become hostage to legacy preferences rather than future needs.

### What Goes Wrong When We Design Around Leaders

When structures are shaped to fit individual leaders, rather than business priorities, a number of predictable challenges arise:

* **Redundant roles and unclear accountability:** Roles are created to ‘fit people in’ rather than solve for clear needs, leading to duplication and blurred ownership.
* **Inefficient spans and uneven workloads:** Some leaders end up stretched thin while others operate in silos, often because comfort or loyalty dictated structure.
* **Decision gridlock and turf conflict:** Overlapping mandates and vague boundaries create friction, slowing down execution and diffusing responsibility.
* **Development bottlenecks:** Leaders are placed into roles without adequate support or challenge, assuming past success translates into future fit.

Designing around individuals may seem like a people-first approach. In reality, it often undermines both individual effectiveness and enterprise performance.

### Leadership Fit Must Be Intentional

Of course, structure alone doesn’t deliver results—people do. But that’s precisely why matching leadership to the demands of the model is essential.

This doesn’t mean removing people. It means deploying them with intent, based on the capabilities and mindset needed to succeed in the new design.

Leaders must ask:
* Does this person have the adaptability, systems thinking, and collaboration skills this model requires?
* Are they prepared to lead across boundaries—not just within a silo?
* What development or coaching might help them grow into the role, rather than around it?

Just because someone thrived under the old model doesn’t guarantee they will excel in the new one. Every design shift is also a leadership shift.

### Design and Leadership Should Reinforce Each Other

The most effective organisations don’t trade-off between structural clarity and leadership alignment. They design for the future—and prepare their leaders to operate within it.

This creates a reinforcing loop:
* Strategy drives the organisation’s design.
* Design defines how the business should work.
* Leaders are selected and supported to bring that design to life.
* And through this alignment, execution improves and momentum builds.

When strategy, structure, and leadership are synchronized, teams operate with greater clarity, energy, and direction. Strategic outcomes are no longer aspirational—they become achievable and sustainable.

### Design with Courage, Lead with Clarity

Organisation design is not about drawing charts to suit personalities. It’s about creating the conditions for sustained success.

That sometimes means making tough decisions: redesigning senior roles, clarifying accountability, or asking leaders to stretch beyond their comfort zones.

The critical question is not “Where should this person go?”

It’s “What does our strategy require—and what kind of leadership will make it real?”

When leaders approach design with this mindset, they move beyond reorganisation. They build a stronger bridge between ambition and action—and lay the foundation for long-term performance, adaptability, and growth.
